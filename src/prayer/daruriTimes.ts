/**
 * The Mālikī second times — issue #19.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * In the Mālikī reckoning each of the five prayers has two windows. The
 * first, *ikhtiyārī*, is the one it should be prayed in. The second,
 * *ḍarūrī*, is still valid but is entered without excuse only at a cost:
 * *"Each one has two times. So, pray it in the first one."*
 * (*Al-Murshid al-Muʿīn*, Ibn ʿĀshir; rendered in *The Guiding Helper*,
 * Abu Qanit al-Sharif al-Hasani, Song 11 lines 388–401 and footnotes
 * 645–665, cited in issue #19.)
 *
 * So what a person actually wants to know is ONE instant per prayer:
 * when the preferred window closes. That is what this module produces.
 * Each window's END is a time the card already shows — Fajr's second
 * time ends at Sunrise, Ẓuhr's and ʿAṣr's at Maghrib, Maghrib's and
 * Ishāʾ's at the next Fajr — so there is nothing to compute there.
 *
 * ── TWO OF THE FIVE ARE ROWS THE CARD ALREADY HAS ─────────────────────
 *
 * The book defines two boundaries as other prayers' beginnings. "The
 * first time of Ẓuhr lasts ... up until the beginning of ʿAṣr's first
 * time" (fn. 656); "Maghrib's first time lasts until the beginning of
 * ʿIshāʾ's first time" (fn. 659), which is where the red twilight goes
 * (fn. 652, 660). The card already carries an ʿAṣr and an Ishāʾ from
 * the user's own chosen authority. Recomputing those two from angles
 * here would put a second ʿAṣr and a second Ishāʾ on the card, a minute
 * or five from the first, and the disagreement would read as a bug
 * rather than as two ways of naming the same instant. So they are the
 * rows. The one exception is Ẓuhr on a Ḥanafī ʿAṣr — see below.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS COMPUTED HERE AND NOT FETCHED ───────────────────────────
 *
 * No provider publishes these. Not AlAdhan, not PrayTimes.dev, not the
 * Habous table the issue is written from. They are derived from solar
 * geometry at the user's own coordinates, which is the one thing the app
 * can always do for itself, and they are shown beside whichever source
 * supplied the day.
 *
 * ── TWO OF THE FIVE ARE GEOMETRY; TWO ARE A MODEL OF A COLOUR ─────────
 *
 * `confidence` carries that difference, and callers are expected to draw
 * it. Ẓuhr's boundary is the ʿAṣr row, Maghrib's is the Ishāʾ row,
 * Ishāʾ's is a third of the night — all three are exact, on the card's
 * own terms. Fajr's *isfār* ("the stars are no longer seen") and ʿAṣr's
 * *iṣfirār* ("the sun has a deep yellow view") are judgements the eye
 * makes, and an angle is a model of them, close but never exact. A
 * reader deserves to know which of the two they are looking at rather
 * than seeing all five printed in the same confident type.
 *
 * Where a modelled angle has a stated range, the app takes the end that
 * closes the preferred window EARLIER — see `ISFAR_ALTITUDE_DEGREES`.
 * These are the ends of the windows a person should be praying in, and
 * the ordinary precaution for an end is to be early.
 *
 * ── THE SHADOW IS ALWAYS 1:1 ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Ẓuhr's first time ends where ʿAṣr's begins, at shadow = height + the
 * noon shadow. That is the Mālikī (and Shāfiʿī) ʿAṣr. When the app's
 * asr setting is 1:1 the ʿAṣr row IS that instant and is reused as is.
 * On Ḥanafī ʿAṣr (2:1) the row is half an hour too late to be a Mālikī
 * boundary, so this module computes the 1:1 shadow itself instead — and
 * the card then carries a Ẓuhr boundary well before its own ʿAṣr, which
 * the setting screen warns about in red where the toggle is.
 *
 * ── REFRACTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Sunrise and sunset here are adhan.js's, taken at −0.833° — the standard
 * allowance for atmospheric refraction plus the sun's own radius, so the
 * moment the disc's upper limb touches the horizon rather than the moment
 * its centre crosses a geometric line. That is what "the appearance of
 * the top of the sun" (fn. 661) asks for, and it is what every published
 * table means by the word.
 *
 * The twilight angles are geometric, which is the convention everywhere:
 * −6° for *isfār* is a position of the sun's centre, not a refracted
 * altitude, and the constants in every madhhab's tables are quoted on
 * that basis. Only *iṣfirār* at +5° sits low enough for refraction to be worth a
 * number — about 9 arcminutes there, which is under a minute of clock
 * time at mid-latitudes and more at high ones. That is well inside the
 * uncertainty of "the sun has a deep yellow view" in the first place,
 * which is why that boundary is `modelled` rather than `computed` and why
 * the row says approx. Correcting it would make the arithmetic tidier
 * without making the answer truer.
 *
 * ── AND SOMETIMES THERE IS NO ANSWER ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * At 33°N every one of these instants happens every day. Further north
 * they do not, and there are three separate ways for that to be true.
 *
 * The angle is never reached. The angle IS reached but the event that
 * would CLOSE the window is not — the case inside
 * `solarDaruriBoundaries`, which is where it is explained, because it is
 * the one that looks like a working answer. And the angle is reached,
 * the window closes, but the boundary lands OUTSIDE the window the
 * card's own rows describe — the case inside `daruriTimesForDay`, and
 * the one that bit: at high latitude Fajr comes from a night-fraction
 * rule or a fixed table rather than from an angle, and Stockholm's
 * dataset gives 02:11 on midsummer's day while *isfār* at −6° is 01:59.
 * "Fajr's first time until 01:59" under a Fajr of 02:11 is a boundary
 * on the wrong side of the prayer it bounds, which is worse than none.
 *
 * All three come out the same way: the key is absent and callers show
 * nothing. A Mālikī in Malmö is better served by a blank he can ask his
 * imam about than by a number the sky does not support.
 *
 * ── AND THE 45° SUBSTITUTE DOES NOT FILL THEM — issue #20 ─────────────
 *
 * *The Guiding Helper* fn. 653 says that where the sun misbehaves one
 * may follow "the prayer timings for the 45° latitude mark at their
 * longitude". Filling these blanks from 45° was built and measured, and
 * over 4,283 place-days from 46°N to 75°N it fills 13 of 817 of them.
 *
 * The reason is in this module rather than in that arithmetic. Every
 * boundary here lives inside a window whose ends are the reader's OWN
 * rows: *isfār* runs to their sunrise, *iṣfirār* to their sunset. Where
 * the sun does not rise there is no end to the window at all, and where
 * it rises but never reaches the angle, a boundary computed 20° south
 * lands outside it — 15:48 under a 13:12 Maghrib at 68°N in January.
 * Two different skies cannot be spliced one row at a time.
 *
 * docs/latitude-45-substitute.md has the measurement and what would
 * change the answer; the code is on `issue-20-lat45-substitute`.

 *
 * ── EVERY BOUNDARY IS CHECKED AGAINST THE CARD'S OWN ROWS ─────────────
 *
 * A boundary is only shown if it lies strictly inside the window the
 * card's rows describe for it: after the prayer it belongs to, before
 * the event that closes the second time. The solar gate in
 * `solarDaruriBoundaries` cannot do this on its own, because the rows do
 * not always come from angles: at high latitude a provider's Fajr is a
 * night-fraction rule or a printed table, and Stockholm's own dataset
 * puts midsummer Fajr at 02:11 while *isfār* at −6° is 01:59. A card
 * saying "Fajr's first time until 01:59" under a Fajr of 02:11 is a
 * boundary on the wrong side of the prayer it bounds — the one thing
 * the test file calls worse than no boundary at all. The same check
 * also drops a boundary that is hours off because the device's time
 * zone is not the location's (a manual location on another continent),
 * where a number would be wrong rather than merely blank.
 *
 * ── ISHĀʾ IS NOT GATED ON THE SUN, AND THAT IS NOT CONVENIENCE ────────
 *
 * The solar boundaries are positions of the sun, and under the midnight
 * sun there is no answer to make. Ishāʾ's is a different KIND of thing:
 * the fiqh defines it as a FRACTION OF THE NIGHT — "one third of the
 * way between sunset and dawn" (fn. 660) — and a fraction is well
 * defined for any interval its two ends are given for. Whatever rule a
 * provider used to produce a Maghrib and a Fajr where the sun does not
 * set, a third of the way between them is a real division of the night
 * that user has been handed. Gating it on sunrise would not be stricter;
 * it would withhold the one boundary of the five that still means
 * something at that latitude. It IS gated on the rows, like the rest:
 * an offline Malmö midsummer where Ishāʾ itself is pushed to 01:10 by a
 * high-latitude rule puts the first third at 23:00, two hours before
 * Ishāʾ begins, and that one is dropped.
 *
 * The same instant as the `Firstthird` row, which has shipped on exactly
 * this basis since issue #14. See `injectDaruriTimes` for why that row
 * stays rather than being replaced by this one.

 * worth — including for the prayer alerts that were already working.
 * So the list starts empty and each boundary is chosen by itself.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT FIRES BEFORE, NOT AT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The row on the card is the reference; the alert is the thing a person
 * acts on, and by the moment a window closes there is nothing left to
 * act on. `leadMinutes` is how much warning the reader asked for. Zero
 * is allowed and means the boundary itself — a statement of fact rather
 * than a prompt, which is what someone tracking their own practice may
 * actually want.
 *
 * Never the adhan. These are not prayer times, and the caller schedules
 * them on the plain notification sound for the same reason Sunrise and
 * the night marks get it (`isNonPrayerEvent`).
 */
/**
 * Ask the caller whether this boundary's prayer is audible on this day.
 *
 * The prayer's instant is `base` plus its own clock time — `base`, not
 * the boundary's date: Ishāʾ's boundary can land after midnight while
 * the prayer it belongs to is still on the evening before, and the
 * question being asked is about the prayer.
 *
 * A clock that will not parse leaves the alert standing. Dropping an
 * alert because a time could not be read would be the wrong way round:
 * the caller asked for this boundary, and silence has to be something
 * chosen rather than something that happens.

   * ── WHY A BOUNDARY FOLLOWS ITS PRAYER INTO SILENCE ──────────────────
   *
   * `silent` on a row means no alarm is registered — not a muted one. It is
   * the reading that also keeps the prayer off the lock screen, and the
   * pre-prayer reminder already goes with it. The boundary alert did not,
   * so someone who silenced Fajr to avoid being woken at 04:30 was still
   * woken at 05:00 by "Fajr's first time ends at 05:15" — an alert about
   * the prayer they had just switched off, in the same sleep.
   *
   * Opt-in cuts the other way too: turning a boundary alert on is a
   * standing choice about a boundary, and silencing a prayer is a more
   * specific choice about one prayer. The specific one wins, and the app
   * ends up with one meaning for silence rather than two.

 * 21:06 — a boundary in the past, presented as if it were still ahead —
 * and the one thing a reader wants at that point, HOW LONG THE SECOND
 * WINDOW RUNS, was nowhere on the card. So:
 *
 *   'second' — the preferred window has closed and the prayer is
 *              unlogged; `at` is when the second window closes (the next
 *              prayer, in the book's own terms — see DARURI_END_OF), so
 *              what is left can be seen.
 *   'first'  — at every other moment: while the preferred window is open,
 *              and again once the prayer is logged or the second window
 *              has closed too. `at` is the first boundary, stated as a
 *              fact of the day, as the other days' cards state it.
 *   null     — no boundary for this day.
 *
 * THE LINE NEVER GOES AWAY, and this is deliberate. A first draft dropped
 * it for a logged prayer — "it has answered the question the line asks" —
 * and the rows shrank one by one as the day was logged, leaving a void
 * under the table by evening (the pager holds every day at one height,
 * and the other days keep all their lines). A row is the same height at
 * 05:00 as at 23:00; only its words change.
 *
 * `week[0]` is the day the card shows and `baseDay` its date; Maghrib's
 * and Ishāʾ's second windows end on `week[1]`, and when that day is not
 * loaded the line falls back to the first boundary rather than to a
 * guess. `approx` is carried for the first window only — the modelled
 * boundaries are the isfār and iṣfirār angles; the second window's end
 * is always one of the card's own rows.
