/**
 * Where a `ibadat365://` link lands.
 *
 * Widgets were the only sender, and notifications are the second — see
 * `notificationRoute`, and #27, where every tapped reminder left you
 * wherever you happened to be. Before this existed a widget tap opened the
 * app on whatever screen it was last on, which is fine for a prayer table —
 * the answer is on the widget already — and useless for the ones whose whole
 * promise is a destination: Continue Reading means page 3 of Al-Baqarah, and
 * a streak card means the Log.
 *
 * Declared rather than hand-rolled: React Navigation's own linking config
 * knows how to build the nested state for "the Quran surah screen, pushed on
 * top of the Quran tab", which a manual `navigate()` from a URL listener has
 * to reconstruct by hand and gets wrong on a cold start.
 *
 * The scheme is app-private. Nothing outside the app is expected to send one,
 * and nothing a link can ask for is destructive — the worst a forged
 * `ibadat365://` does is change which tab is showing.

/**
 * A tapped notification, turned into a link — all three ways a tap arrives.

 * own, so both have to keep doing what the defaults did (`Linking`) as
 * well as the new thing. Getting that wrong breaks every widget on the
 * home screen, which is the more used half of this file.
 *
 * The three cases are genuinely three:
 *
 *   • app running       — notifee's foreground PRESS event;
 *   • app in the background — the same event, once the press brings it
 *     forward;
 *   • app not running   — `getInitialNotification`, and this is the case
 *     that is usually forgotten and is the ordinary one for a reminder
 *     that arrives hours after the app was last opened.
