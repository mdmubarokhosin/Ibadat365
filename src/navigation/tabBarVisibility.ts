/**
 * The tab bar gets out of the way when you are reading, and comes back the
 * moment you look like you want it.
 *
 * ── WHY A MODULE AND NOT A CONTEXT ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A scroll handler fires every frame. Putting that through React context
 * would re-render every consumer of the context on every frame of every
 * scroll, on six screens, to move one bar. This is the same read-through
 * store the practice screens use: the scroll writes to a module variable,
 * and only a CHANGE of direction notifies anybody.
 *
 * ── THE RULES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS THERE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Hide on the way down, show on the way up — but not literally, or the bar
 * flickers on every stutter of a thumb. So:
 *
 *   • nothing happens in the first `FLOOR` points, because a list that has
 *     barely moved is not "scrolling down", it is settling;
 *   • a direction has to be sustained for `THRESHOLD` points before it
 *     counts, which is what stops a shaking hand strobing the bar;
 *   • the top always shows it, unconditionally, because arriving back at
 *     the top of a list is the clearest "I am done reading" there is;
 *   • and any bounce past the end is ignored, since an over-scroll is the
 *     list moving, not the reader.
