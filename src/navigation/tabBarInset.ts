/**
 * The floating tab bar's geometry, in one place — v2.8.5.
 *
 * The bar is absolutely positioned so that content passes UNDERNEATH it:
 * a list that ends exactly at a solid bar looks finished, and the reader
 * has no way to tell whether there is more below. A page sliding under a
 * floating pill says "there is more here" without spending a pixel on
 * saying it.
 *
 * The price of that is that the navigator no longer reserves any space,
 * so every scrolling screen has to reserve it instead — and a screen that
 * forgets ends with its last row permanently hidden. Hence one module:
 * the bar and the six screens read the same numbers, and changing the
 * bar's height cannot leave a screen behind.

 * to float over a live page, and a band painted behind it would just be a
 * stripe across the bottom of every screen.

 * and Android moves the button bar to one END of the long edge: the
 * `navigationBars` bottom inset goes to zero and the width appears on the
 * left or right instead. `buttonBarHeight` is a property of the BAR, not
 * of where it is, so taking the larger of the two painted a full-width
 * band across a landscape window with no buttons anywhere near it — over
