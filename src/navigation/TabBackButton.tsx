/**
 * The way back to Today, in the title bar of every other tab.
 *
 * ── WHY A TAB HAS A BACK BUTTON AT ALL ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because this app already behaves as though it does. `decideAndroidBack`
 * has always sent hardware back from Quran, Tasbih, Duas, the Log and
 * Settings to Today, and treated Today as the one screen you cannot leave
 * — so the model is not six peer tabs, it is Today plus five pages you
 * went to. That model was only ever expressed in a gesture. Someone on a
 * page with a title bar and no arrow in it reads the tabs as peers, and
 * then the hardware back landing on Today looks like a bug rather than the
 * rule it is.
 *
 * So the arrow says out loud what the gesture already did. It is the same
 * control a pushed page gets from the navigator — the system one there,
 * this one here, because a tab's header is drawn in JS and has no back
 * control of its own to turn on.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT ANDROID-ONLY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The hardware-back rule is, because only Android has the button. The
 * MEANING is not: Today is home on every platform, and a back arrow that
 * appeared and vanished with the OS would make the same screen a different
 * shape on a phone and on an iPad — which is exactly the kind of drift the
 * six tabs were unified to stop.
 *
 * ── THE ARROW ITSELF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Drawn to match the platform's own: a thin chevron on iOS, an arrow with
 * a shaft on Android, at the same 2pt stroke the rest of the header icons
 * use. It has to read as a sibling of the arrow on a pushed settings page,
 * because a user moving between them is looking at one control.
 *
 * Mirrored under RTL. The glyph points at where "back" is on screen, which
 * is the trailing edge in Arabic, Urdu, Farsi and Hebrew — a chevron is
 * direction, not a letter, so it flips.
