 * ── WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One level at a time, ending at Today:
 *
 *   surah reader  →  the Quran tab  →  Today  →  out of the app
 *
 * A pushed page goes back to the tab it was opened from; a tab's own root
 * goes to Today; Today itself is not handled here at all, so the system
 * does what the system does and leaves the app.
 *
 * ── WHY IT DID NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to read `navigation.getState().index` and pop when it was
 * greater than zero. That is right for a pushed page and wrong for a tab,
 * because `useNavigation()` returns the CLOSEST navigator — the root stack
 * inside the reader, but the TAB navigator inside the Quran tab. On the
 * Quran tab the "index" being read was the tab's own index (1), so back
 * dispatched a stack pop at a bottom-tab navigator, which quietly does
 * nothing, and then returned true to say it had been handled. Back on any
 * tab but Today did nothing at all.
 *
 * The fallback was no better: `navigate('Home')` names the root stack
 * screen that HOLDS the tabs, so from inside them it is a no-op — it does
 * not select a tab. Going to Today means naming the tab.
 *
 * So the navigator's own `type` decides, rather than an index whose
 * meaning depends on where the hook was called from.

 *   only because RN calls the most recently added listener first, which is
