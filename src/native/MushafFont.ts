/**
 * Runtime mushaf font registration — v2.8.0.
 *
 * The font-rendered mushaf needs one font per page (QPC v2: one glyph = one
 * word), and all 604 are downloaded rather than bundled, so they cannot be
 * declared at build time. Both platforms can register a font file at runtime;
 * this is the typed wrapper plus the slot pool that keeps that bounded.
 *
 * ## Why slots
 *
 * React Native caches a typeface per `fontFamily` string and never evicts it.
 * If we addressed fonts as "QCF2001"…"QCF2604", reading the whole mushaf in
 * one sitting would pin 604 typefaces in memory. Instead a small ring of slot
 * families ("MihrabMushaf0"…) is reused: a slot is re-registered with a
 * different page's file when it is recycled, which releases the previous
 * typeface. Pages that are currently mounted are pinned so a slot can never be
 * repurposed out from under a page that is still on screen — that would show
 * another page's words in this page's shape.
 *
 * The pool is deliberately much larger than the pager's mounted window (5), so
 * fast swiping never has to wait on a re-registration, and a page swiped back
 * to is usually still resident.
