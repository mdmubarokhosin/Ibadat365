/**
 * What the log can say about one prayer.
 *
 * ── WHY `cleared` IS A STATUS AND NOT A DELETION ──────────────────────
 *
 * Un-logging used to drop the row. That is correct on one device and
 * wrong the moment there are two: `mergeJournal` is a last-write-wins
 * register keyed by (date, prayer), so an absent row carries no opinion
 * and the other device's copy simply wins. Removing a mis-tap on your
 * phone, then syncing, put it straight back — silently, and by design
 * (`merge.ts` says in as many words that nothing is ever deleted).
 *
 * Issue #13 made that a real cost rather than a theoretical one: someone
 * back-filled three months by accident and asked for a way out. A reset
 * that the next sync round undoes is not a way out.
 *
 * So a clear is a WRITE, not a deletion — a row with `cleared` and a fresh
 * `loggedAt`. The merge needs no new rule and none of its three properties
 * move: it is still newest-wins on the same key, with one more value in
 * the domain. Nothing accumulates either, because a tombstone REPLACES the
 * entry it clears rather than sitting beside it.
 *
 * Everything that reads the journal must treat it as unlogged. The single
 * place that guarantees it is `indexByDate`, which every streak and score
 * goes through; `isLogged` is the check for anywhere else.
