/**
 * Sunnah prayers — the voluntary prayers attached to each fard prayer.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN `journal.ts`. The journal is a flat array of entries
 * keyed by `(date, prayer)`, and `coerceJournalEntries` whitelists exactly the
 * five fard prayer names and four statuses — anything else it finds is
 * SILENTLY DROPPED on the next read. Three separate places write that array
 * (the Log screen, the notification action, the end-of-day reminder), and its
 * `kept` score is consumed as `kept / 5` by the graph. A sunnah entry living
 * in there would have to widen the validator in a build that ships before any
 * build that writes one, thread a new field through all three writers, and be
 * kept out of `kept` by hand. Its own store costs none of that and cannot
 * corrupt a log of obligatory prayers, which is the data users care about most.
 *
 * The shape is a map of day → counts, like `DhikrLog`, rather than a list of
 * events. A day is a small fixed set of yes/no-ish facts, and asking "what did
 * this day hold" is the only question anything asks.
 *
 * A day that was never touched is simply absent, and absent reads as all
 * zeros — so there is no migration, and an install that predates this feature
 * starts empty rather than wrong.

 * How many sunnah prayers each fard prayer carries.

 * These are the sunnah mu'akkadah as this app counts them. They differ by
 * school — Hanafis commonly count four before Dhuhr and four before Asr — and
 * this table is deliberately fixed rather than derived from the school
 * setting: the totals are the denominator of both the day's ring and the
 * streak, so a per-user denominator would have to be stored per day to keep
 * old days meaning what they meant when they were logged. If that becomes
 * wanted, the migration is to stamp each stored day with the total it was
 * judged against, and this table becomes the default rather than the rule.
