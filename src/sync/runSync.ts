/**
 * A round of sync, with the reasons it did not happen named.
 *
 * `folderSync.ts` is the algorithm and takes a folder it is handed;
 * `folderAccess.ts` produces one; this decides whether to run at all,
 * records when it last did, and turns every failure into something a screen
 * can say out loud.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERY REFUSAL HAS ITS OWN NAME ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Sync failed" is the least useful thing an app can tell someone. Not
 * choosing a folder, revoking the grant in system settings, and a folder
 * that stopped syncing because a device was removed are three different
 * situations with three different fixes, and the user can act on all of
 * them once they are told which one they are in.
