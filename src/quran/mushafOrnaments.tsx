/**
 * The illuminated furniture of a mushaf page — the surah band and the
 * basmalah that open every surah.
 *
 * In the Madinah print a surah does not begin with a line of text; it begins
 * with a **band**: a rectangle ruled twice, its border filled with worked
 * ornament, a rosette closing each end, and the surah's name set in the middle.
 * The basmalah follows it, unframed, in the same hand as the page.
 *
 * We are not reproducing the illumination — the print's is polychrome gold and
 * lapis, and imitating it badly is worse than not imitating it. What is drawn
 * here is its *structure*, in one colour, at the app's own weight: the double
 * rule, a dentil course between the rules, and an eight-point rosette at each
 * end. That reads as deliberate at the size a phone actually renders it, which
 * a traced arabesque does not — it turns to mud below about 40 dp of height.
 *
 * Everything is expressed as a fraction of the band's height, so it holds
 * together from a phone in portrait to an iPad spread without a second set of
 * numbers.
