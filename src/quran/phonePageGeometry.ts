/**
 * The phone page's geometry — as one value, published once per change.
 *
 * ── WHAT A ROTATION USED TO COST ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mushaf page is fifteen justified lines in a page-specific font, ~260
 * drawn pieces, laid out by the platform's text engine. It is worth laying
 * out exactly once per size, and the phone reader was laying it out three
 * times per rotation and twice per fullscreen toggle — for every mounted
 * page, so nine and six layouts of Arabic text on a phone that was also
 * trying to animate the rotation.
 *
 * The cause was that the page's box was assembled from inputs that arrive
 * on different frames and were each fed straight through:
 *
 *   1. `useWindowDimensions` swaps width and height at once. The page was
 *      laid out at the new width against the OLD list height, which the
 *      list had not re-measured yet.
 *   2. On a notched phone the safe-area insets change a render later —
 *      landscape puts the notch on a side — so `pageWidth` changed again,
 *      and the page was laid out again.
 *   3. The list's own `onLayout` then arrived with the real height, and
 *      `useSettledMeasure` published it a hundred milliseconds after it
 *      stopped moving: the layout that was actually wanted, third.
 *
 * Fullscreen on iOS was the same shape: the floating header's height came
 * out of the box immediately, then the list re-measured, then the page
 * was laid out again.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every input that decides the page's box is folded into ONE geometry
 * here, and that one value is what settles — so a burst of inputs, however
 * many frames it takes, publishes one geometry when it is over. Until
 * then the page keeps the geometry it has: an old page briefly stretched
 * under the rotation animation, which the platform is cross-fading anyway,
 * rather than three fresh ones nobody sees.
 *
 * And a page is never laid out against a GUESSED viewport. Before the
 * list has been measured there is no geometry, and the reader draws
 * nothing in the box; the first page waits on its font for longer than
 * that anyway.
