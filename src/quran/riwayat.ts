/**
 * Which reading tradition the muṣḥaf is drawn in.
 *
 * ── A TABLE, NOT AN `if (warsh)` ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Sweden was the only regional prayer-times source until Morocco arrived,
 * and the `if (isCoordinateInSweden(...))` that had been honest for a year
 * became a liability in an afternoon — every call site hardcoded the same
 * country and would have needed editing in step for the next one
 * (`settings/regionalProviders.ts`). The same shape is waiting here: QUL
 * publishes QPC fonts for Warsh, Qālūn, al-Dūrī, al-Sūsī and Shuʿbah, and
 * the only reason four of them are not in this table today is that nobody
 * has published their TEXT. When one appears it should be a row here and a
 * data file, not a search for every place that assumed two riwayat.
 *
 * ── WHY `available` IS COMPUTED, NOT DECLARED ─────────────────────────
 *
 * A riwayah's data is a separate artefact with its own provenance, and
 * Mihrab does not ship it — nobody publishes a Warsh text under terms the
 * app could redistribute under, so the reader obtains it from whoever
 * does (`riwayahStore.ts`, `docs/design/riwayat-plan.md` §0). The table
 * therefore describes what the app knows how to DRAW; what this device
 * actually HAS is a question for `riwayahData.ts`, and it can change
 * while the app is running.
 *
 * That is why there is no `totalPages` here either. A muṣḥaf's page count
 * is a fact about the print that arrives WITH the data — inheriting the
 * Madinah Hafs 604 and hoping is exactly how a second riwayah would
 * silently mis-paginate — so it is derived from the pagination itself
 * (`totalPagesForRiwayah`) and never declared.
