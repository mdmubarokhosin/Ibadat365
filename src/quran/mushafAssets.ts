/**
 * Reconciling the Quran files on disk with the ones this build actually reads.
 *
 * Two kinds of stale file can be sitting in an install that has been UPDATED
 * rather than freshly installed, and neither of them announces itself:
 *
 * - **The retired page images.** Up to ~120 MB of PNGs plus their render
 *   cache, from the mushaf reader that 2.8.0 replaced with the font-rendered
 *   one. Nothing has read them since. They were only ever swept when the user
 *   happened to start a font download from inside the reader, so anyone who
 *   opened the reader once, said "not now" and never went back is still
 *   carrying the whole thing.
 * - **Page fonts from a superseded release.** The store had no record of
 *   which release filled it, so a corrected font could be published and every
 *   existing reader would keep drawing from the old files forever — the one
 *   failure mode you cannot ask a user to work around, because from inside
 *   the app the pages look fine.
 *
 * So the store now carries a stamp naming the release it was filled from, and
 * this runs once per launch: sweep what is retired, drop what is superseded,
 * and leave alone what is current.
 *
 * A store with NO stamp is adopted rather than dropped. It predates the stamp
 * and its files are the current release by construction — re-fetching 180 MB
 * on the strength of a missing bookkeeping file would be this update charging
 * every existing reader for our own change of mind.
