/**
 * A mushaf page, drawn — and the one place that decides HOW.
 *
 * Wraps a page renderer with everything the reader shouldn't have to know
 * about: which riwayah is open and therefore which renderer draws it,
 * fetching and registering a glyph page's font, the placeholder shown while
 * that happens, night-mode colours (a repaint, not an image inversion), the
 * opening plates' frame, and the fallback signal when a page's font can't be
 * had at all.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DISPATCH LIVES HERE ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two renderers and four readers (phone, phone-landscape, spread,
 * and the legacy image reader's text branch). Asking each reader which
 * renderer to use would be the same question answered four times, and the
 * fifth reader — or the fifth riwayah — is exactly where one of the copies
 * gets forgotten. A reader asks for "page 42 of this riwayah, this big";
 * everything after that is this file's problem.

 * Fit `lineCount` lines into `boxH`, leaving room for the ink that

 *
 * ── THE CUT THAT `lineInkPadding` DOES NOT REACH ──────────────────────
 *
 * A line's ink overshoots its metrics by up to 0.4 em above and 0.2 em
 * below, and `lineInkPadding` gives the text view room for it — padding
 * the view and pulling the padding back with a negative margin, so the
 * baseline does not move. That works everywhere INSIDE a page, because
 * the room borrowed is a neighbouring line's box and a line box is
 * transparent: the maddah over an alif is drawn across the bottom of the
 * line above it and nobody can tell.
 *
 * The first and last lines have no neighbour to borrow from. They borrow
 * from outside the page, and whatever contains the page clips it there —
 * the landscape column is a `ScrollView`, and a `ScrollView` on Android
 * always clips its content. So the top line lost the marks ABOVE it while
 * keeping every letter, which reads as a broken font rather than a clip,
 * and the bottom line lost its deepest swashes.
 *
 * It shows worst in the landscape column, where the recitation's
 * follow-scroll comes to rest exactly on a line box (`followOffset`) — so
 * the line at the top of the viewport is cut at precisely the height
 * where the harakat live, on every scroll, not just at the top of a page.
 *
 * So the page reserves that room out of its own box: the lines are a hair
 * shorter and the block is padded by what the ink needs. The scrolling
 * column asks for the reserve back in its height instead
 * (`mushafPageColumnHeight`), which keeps the landscape reading zoom
 * exactly where it was.
