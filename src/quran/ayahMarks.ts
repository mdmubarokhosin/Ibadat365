/**
 * What is marked on a muṣḥaf page, and in what colour.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS SHARED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two text renderers draw the page — the glyph renderer for Ḥafṣ and the
 * unicode renderer for the other riwāyāt — and a mark on either is a
 * background on the ayah's own runs. A difference in mechanism is not a
 * reason for the two to disagree about WHAT is marked or what colour it
 * takes, so that part lives here, in one place, and each renderer applies
 * it in whatever way it draws. (The image renderer this was first shared
 * with, which painted a box over each ayah's line rectangles, is gone.)
 *
 * ── THE ONE RULE ABOUT ALPHA ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A mark must never compete with the ink. These opacities were tuned on
 * the image overlay and kept, and they are low on purpose: the page reads
 * exactly as it did, and the colour is a wash under the words rather than
 * a band over them. Night mode gets more because a translucent colour on
 * a near-black ground is much weaker than the same colour on cream.
