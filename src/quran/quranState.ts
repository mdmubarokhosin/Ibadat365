/**
 * Quran reader state — QR-10/12/19/21 (docs/quran-reader-plan.md).
 *
 * Feature-local persistent store for everything the reader remembers:
 * last-read position, bookmarks, starred ayahs, khatmah plans, and
 * playback/memorization preferences. Deliberately its OWN AsyncStorage
 * blob (`mihrab.quran.v1`) rather than a new field on the settings
 * context — the reader state changes on every page turn and must not
 * re-render every settings consumer in the app.
 *
 * Pattern: module-level in-memory state + subscriber set, exposed to
 * React via `useSyncExternalStore` (see `useQuranState`). All writes are
 * serialized through a mutex like `prayerStorage.ts` so a page-turn
 * write can't race a bookmark write and drop data.
 *
 * Schema is additive-only (same rule as the settings blob).

 * Record where the reader is — issue #41.
 *
 * ── TWO TRAILS THROUGH ONE BOOK ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lastRead` is the reading marker: the place "Continue reading" hands
 * back. A khatmah is a second trail with its own marker (the plan's next
 * page, `khatmahContinueTarget`), and a reader can walk both — the plan
 * in the morning, Al-Kahf on a Friday — which is a thing this store used
 * to make impossible: every page turn wrote `lastRead`, so an evening in
 * the khatmah erased the afternoon's place in Al-Kahf, and the marker
 * was never more than "the last page looked at".
 *
 * So the khatmah's own reading — a muṣḥaf page within reach of the
 * plan's page — leaves the marker where it is, UNLESS the marker was
 * already riding with the plan, in which case it comes along. That
 * second clause is what keeps a reader with one trail exactly where
 * they were: every marker written before this existed sits on the
 * plan's page, and a marker that stopped following would have looked
 * like a lost place. The moment such a reader reads somewhere else, the
 * marker detaches and becomes theirs; the moment it is theirs, the
 * khatmah cannot take it back.
 *
 * Translation mode always writes. Khatmah progress is credited from
 * muṣḥaf page turns and nowhere else, so a plan read in translation
 * never advances on its own — and a marker that refused to follow that
 * reading would be a place lost with nothing to point at it instead.

 * into equal ayah counts is not a plan anyone would recognise. Al-Baqarah
 * runs at a handful of long ayahs to the page and juzʾ ʿamma at forty
 * short ones, so an even thirtieth of the 6,236 ayahs asked for 36 pages
 * on day two of a thirty-day khatmah and 8 on day twenty-eight — four and
 * a half times the reading, on a plan whose whole promise is that every
 * day is the same. Cut by page it is 20 or 21 every day, which is the
 * number every khatmah in the world is quoted in.
 *
 * Ḥafṣ's pages, whichever muṣḥaf is being read. The division belongs to
 * the PLAN, not to the muṣḥaf in hand — a boundary that moved when the
 * reader changed riwayah would move their day under them, which is the
 * one thing this model exists to prevent. All four muṣḥafs run to 604
 * pages, so the portion is the same reading either way; only the page
 * NUMBERS shown alongside it are the reader's own (`khatmahPages`).
 *
 * The boundary is still an ayah, so progress needs no conversion and the
 * marker still falls on something the page can point at.

 * reader and not the schedule — while the days left came from midnights

 *
 * ── AND WHY IT IS NOT THE DAY'S PORTION EITHER ────────────────────────
 *
 * Because that is pinned, on purpose. `khatmahDay` reports the portion
 * the day STARTED in, so that finishing it and reading on leaves the day
 * showing as done rather than silently becoming a new unfinished one —
 * and a reader who sat down at page 90 and read to page 551 is still on
 * "day 5" until tomorrow, which is what was asked for.

 * lines differently. Answering out of the Ḥafṣ pagination for a reader in
 * Shuʿbah is quietly wrong by a page here and there all the way down the
 * book.
 *
 * So the ayahs are converted through the pagination of the muṣḥaf in
 * hand. `pagesForRiwayah` falls back to Ḥafṣ for a riwayah this build
 * cannot draw, which is the right way to be wrong: that reader is in
