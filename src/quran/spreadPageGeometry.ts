/**
 * The spread reader's geometry — one value, published once per change.
 *
 * The same discipline as `phonePageGeometry.ts`, for the reader an iPad
 * and a Mac use. Rotating an iPad re-pairs the list — portrait is one
 * page per item, landscape a facing pair — so the items themselves are
 * new; but the size each page was then laid out AT was assembled the same
 * way as the phone's, from a live window height, a live header height and
 * a list height that had not been re-measured yet, and every new item was
 * laid out at that guess before being laid out again at the truth.
 *
 * Here the geometry carries the shape it was computed FOR — the item width
 * and whether items are pairs — so the reader can tell a settled geometry
 * that belongs to the list on screen from one left over from before the
 * rotation. Until they agree, a column draws its chrome and no page: a
 * blank page for the tail of a rotation the platform is animating anyway,
 * rather than a page laid out twice.

 *
 * Each column used to pad itself by `H_PADDING` and centre the page in
 * what was left. When the page is HEIGHT-capped — which on a wide Mac
 * window it always is — the leftover width is wider than that padding,
 * and centring splits it evenly on both sides of each column. Both inner
 * halves then land against each other, so the gutter between the two
 * pages came out at twice the margin against the window's edges. A book
 * is not set that way.
 *
 * So the slack is divided into THREE equal parts — outer, gutter, outer —
 * and each page is placed against its own share rather than centred in a
 * box.
