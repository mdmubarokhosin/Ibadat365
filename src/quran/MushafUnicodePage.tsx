/**
 * A muṣḥaf page drawn from Unicode text — the second renderer.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE ARE TWO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `MushafTextPage` is a GLYPH pipeline: 604 per-page fonts, private-use
 * codepoints, and a hand-justified line table (`mushafLayoutV2.json`). It
 * reproduces the Madinah print line for line, and every one of its
 * codepoints is meaningful only against that page's own font. It is not
 * text; it is a picture of text made of characters.
 *
 * A second riwayah cannot use any of it. What QUL publishes for Warsh is
 * the mirror image — real Unicode text, one font, `page_number` per ayah
 * and NO line assignment — so there is no adapter that makes it fit. See
 * `docs/design/riwayat-plan.md` §2.
 *
 * So this renderer draws the ayahs a page holds as ordinary text and lets
 * the platform break the lines. The trade, stated plainly because someone
 * who has memorised a physical muṣḥaf will notice: **page boundaries are
 * exact, line breaks are not.** What it buys is exact text, in the right
 * script, on the right page, with nothing to download.
 *
 * ── HOW A PAGE IS SIZED ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The glyph page knows its font size from the print's own measure. This
 * one has no measure to work from: the same ayahs set larger simply take
 * more lines. So the page is FITTED — sized so its content fills the box
 * it was given and no more — by predicting a size, measuring what the
 * platform actually laid out, and correcting.
 *
 * Two things keep that from being a visible loop:
 *
 *   • the fitted size is cached per page and box, so a page is fitted
 *     once and every later visit is instant; and
 *   • each measurement calibrates the advance estimate the prediction
 *     uses (`calibratedAdvanceEm`), so after the first page or two the
 *     first guess is already right and no correction pass happens at all.
 *
 * The page is drawn while it converges rather than hidden until it has.
 * A page that reflows once on its first appearance is a smaller fault
 * than a page that stays blank because a measurement never arrived.

 * the line is left short and centred, which is the honest end of it.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THERE IS NO FLOOR TO MATCH IT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the two directions are not symmetric. A line that falls SHORT
 * has somewhere to stop: centre it, and it reads as a short line. A line
 * that runs LONG has nowhere — the measure is the edge of the page, and
 * past the ceiling of a squeeze there is nothing to catch it, so it is
 * simply drawn into the margin.
 *
 * There used to be a floor at 0.8, and it bound: the second line from the
 * foot of Shuʿbah page 30 carries 21.7 em of words against an 18.2 em
 * measure, needs 0.754 with its gaps already shut, got 0.8, and hung 6%
 * past the margin. Eight lines in Shuʿbah and seven in Warsh did the
 * same. Lowering the floor to clear them would have been fitting a
 * constant to two editions and calling it a rule; a third edition, or a
 * wider phone, would find the next one.
 *
 * So the squeeze is not bounded. Whatever the line is, it is drawn inside
 * the measure — `riwayahUnicodePage` asserts that for every shape of line
 * there is, not for the ones we happen to have. What a squeeze costs is
 * condensed letterforms, and over both editions the worst any line asks
 * for is 0.754 with 14 of 8,807 below 0.8 at all, so what it costs in

 * which is what page 5 was. And it has a ceiling, so the lines that
 * needed more than the ceiling simply did not reach the margin, which is
 * the void.
 *
 * The print does not stretch letters. It opens the word gaps, and
 * `mushafLayout` already has the band they may move inside and the exact
 * advance of the bundled space to compute them with — the Hafs pages have
 * justified this way since they were written. `natural` is what the line
 * is with no gap at all, so the gap that closes it is arithmetic rather
 * than a search, and the scaling that remains is the few per cent the
 * band could not take.

/**
 * A page laid out on the print's own lines.
 *
 * ── WHY NOTHING HERE IS MODELLED ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first four attempts at this priced the text: an advance per
 * character, a width per medallion, a solved word gap. Every one of them
 * produced a page that was either short of the margin — a hole in the
 * setting — or past it. And past it is not a cosmetic fault: a line wider
 * than its box does not clip on Android, it WRAPS, and the wrapped
 * remainder is drawn below a row whose height leaves no room for it. Page
 * 8 lost the last letter of الْعَذَابِ that way, and line six lost its ayah
 * number, with nothing on screen to say either had happened.
 *
 * So nothing is priced. Each line is laid out in a box far wider than it
 * can need, which makes wrapping impossible and therefore makes losing a
 * word impossible. It is then MEASURED, and scaled horizontally to the
 * measure exactly. A line cannot come out short, because the scale is
 * computed from its own drawn width; and it cannot come out long, for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * The type size is chosen so the median line needs no scaling at all,
 * which keeps what scaling remains small and even — a few per cent either
 * way, spread across the page rather than piled onto one line.

   * The size to draw at — ONE size, for every page of the muṣḥaf.
   *
   * A printed muṣḥaf does not change its type from page to page. The line
   * grid fixes the size and the setter fits words to lines at that size;
   * a page whose lines carry fewer letters comes out with more air on
   * them, not with bigger letters on them.
   *
   * This used to derive the size from the page's own measured lines — the
   * size at which THIS page's median line needed no scaling. Every page
   * therefore chose independently, and since the cap allowed anything up
   * to `rowHeight / 1.5`, a sparse page could be set 37% larger than a
   * dense one. Page 5 next to page 3 is what that looks like, and it
   * reads as a different book.
   *
   * All 602 pages of the table have exactly fifteen rows, so `rowHeight`
   * is already the same on every one of them. Taking the size from the
   * row height and nothing else therefore makes the type the same on
   * every one of them too — by construction, with nothing to converge and
   * nothing to cache. What a page's own words decide is its `scaleX`
   * below, which is a few per cent of width, not a third of a size.
   *
   * `PRINTED_LINE_HEIGHT_EM` is where that one ratio lives, and it is the
   * leading the marks need; the old cap bought width by clipping the very
   * diacritics the Warsh orthography leans on.
   *
   * The measure has the same vote as the row, and for the same reason —
   * see `PRINTED_TYPICAL_LINE_EM`. Whichever is tighter decides.
   *
   * ── AND THE LEFTOVER HEIGHT GOES INTO THE LEADING ──────────────────
   *
   * A box taller than the page's proportions — full screen is one — leaves
   * height the type cannot use, because using it would make the lines
   * wider than the measure. Banking it as margin above and below is a
   * void at each end of the page, which is not what the extra room is
   * for. It goes into the ROWS instead: the same fifteen lines, set
   * further apart.
   *
   * This is the answer the Hafs pages already give. `MushafReader`'s
   * `MAX_VERTICAL_STRETCH` stretches the printed page into the same free
   * space rather than letterboxing it, and caps the stretch at 1.25
   * because past that the calligraphy reads as drawn out. Nothing is drawn
   * out here — the letters keep their size and only the space between the
   * lines opens — so the cap can be a little looser, and full screen on a
   * phone wants about 1.23 of it.
