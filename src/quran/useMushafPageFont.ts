 * Two steps, in order: get the file on disk (downloading it if this is the
 * first visit), then register it with the platform so a `<Text>` can name it.
 * The returned family is null until both have happened, which is the reader's
 * cue to show the page's placeholder rather than a blank sheet.
 *
 * The pin/unpin pair is what stops the font slot pool from recycling a font

 * ── WHY THE FILE ON DISK WAS NOT ENOUGH ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The neighbours' fonts were prefetched — to disk. Registering one with
 * the platform is the other half, and it was left to the page's own mount:
 * two bridge round-trips to confirm the file, then a native font parse,
 * then a state update, and only then the page. Every page swiped to from
 * outside the mounted window showed its spinner for that long, which on a
 * fast flick is a flicker on every page.
 *
 * The slot pool has room for it — 23 slots against at most six mounted
 * pages — and a slot claimed for a neighbour is unpinned, so it is the
 * first to be recycled if the pool ever fills. After interactions, not
 * during: a font parse on the main thread in the middle of the turn
 * animation is a dropped frame, and the whole point is smoothness.
