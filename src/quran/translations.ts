/**
 * Quran translation registry — task #96.
 *
 * Multiple Tanzil-derived translation editions ship with the app so the
 * user can pick the one that matches their preferred language. Default
 * follows the active app locale (see `defaultEditionForLocale`).
 *
 * They ship as ASSETS, not inside the JS bundle. The fourteen editions
 * are ~17 MB, and `index.android.bundle` is STORED in the APK — Android
 * does not compress a `.bundle`, so every one of those megabytes was
 * paid at full price on every download. As ordinary assets they
 * compress like the JSON they are: the APK went from 50.1 MB to 37.3.
 * They are still inside the app, so nothing about reading offline
 * changes — only where the bytes sit and what it costs to send them.
 *
 * Each edition's text lives at `assets/quran/translations/{id}.json` as a
 * chapter-keyed object: `{ "1": { "1": "In the name…", … }, … }`.
 * Metro requires literal require paths so we enumerate explicitly.
 *
 * Source: alquran.cloud (Tanzil corpus). License notes:
 *   - Sahih International: public domain
 *   - Pickthall: public domain
 *   - Tanzil-distributed editions: respective translator licenses,
 *     redistributed under CC BY 3.0 by Tanzil.

 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ASYNC WHEN ITS BODY IS NOT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The body still returns a bundled `require`, synchronously, and this
 * still resolves on the first tick. The signature has moved ahead of it
 * on purpose, because the thirteen editions are about to stop being part
 * of the JS bundle.
 *
 * They are ~18 MB of the bundle's 26, and `assets/index.android.bundle`
 * is STORED in the APK — zero compression, because Android does not
 * compress a `.bundle`. The same JSON as an ordinary asset gzips to
 * about 4.5 MB. Moving it is roughly thirteen megabytes off a fifty
 * megabyte download, and it costs nothing anybody can see: the files
 * still ship inside the app, so nothing about reading the Qur'an
 * offline changes.
 *
 * Reading a file is asynchronous, and three of the call sites read a
 * translation in a component's render body — where a promise cannot go.
 * So the signature changes first, on its own, with the body untouched:
 * every caller is moved and proven while the data is still coming from
 * the same place it always did. `loadSurah` in `quran.ts` has had
 * exactly this shape for a while — an async façade over a sync require
 * switch — which is what makes this a small step rather than a leap.
 */
/**
 * One edition at a time, and the read that is fetching it.
 *
 * Metro's require cache used to do this for free — that is the only
 * reason `getAyahTranslation` could sit in a render body and cost
 * nothing after the first ayah. A read from disk has no such cache, and
 * the render-path callers would have re-read a megabyte per render
 * without one.
 *
 * The in-flight promise is held as well as the result, so a screen that
 * mounts three components asking for the same edition at once does one
 * read rather than three. Same shape as `ensureSearchCorpus`.
 *
 * Bounded to ONE edition. A reader has a translation, not a library of
 * them, and the whole point of this move is to stop carrying editions
 * nobody asked for.
