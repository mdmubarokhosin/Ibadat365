/**
 * The Quran download, as the system sees it.
 *
 * ── WHY A NOTIFICATION AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The mushaf is six hundred and four pages and the fonts are a hundred and
 * eighty megabytes; a reciter's Quran is six thousand two hundred and
 * thirty-six files. These are downloads people start and then go and do
 * something else. Until there was a notification, "something else" meant
 * leaving the Quran screen, which cancelled it — so the only way to get
 * the whole book was to sit and watch a progress bar. A notification is
 * what makes the download something the phone is doing rather than
 * something the screen is doing.
 *
 * ── ANDROID ONLY, AND HONESTLY SO ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On Android the notification is a foreground service: it is what tells the
 * system this work is deliberate, and it is why the download survives the
 * app going into the background. iOS has neither a progress notification
 * nor a way for a JavaScript download to continue once the app is
 * suspended, so there is nothing here to show — the in-app progress on the
 * Quran screen is the whole story on that platform, and pretending
 * otherwise with a notification that cannot update would be worse than
 * saying nothing.
 *
 * ── TWO NOTIFICATIONS, NOT ONE ID USED TWICE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Reported 2026-09-04: the "Downloading the Quran text" bar was still in
 * the shade after the download had finished.
 *
 * The progress bar and the final word used to share an id. Replacing one
 * with the other looks like the tidy thing to do — the bar becomes the
 * result, in place — but the progress notification is not an ordinary
 * notification: it IS the foreground service. Cancelling it asks Android
 * to tear a service down, which has not happened by the time the next line
 * runs, and posting the same id back into that gap hands the new
 * notification the old one's ongoing flag. What is left is a notification
 * that says the download finished and cannot be swiped away, or one that
 * still says it is running and never changes again.
 *
 * So the result gets an id of its own. The bar is cancelled and stays
 * cancelled, and nothing the finished run posts can inherit anything from
 * the service.
 *
 * ── AND ONE THAT OUTLIVED THE PROCESS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The other way to be left with a stuck bar is for the app to die while it
 * is up — a crash, a Force stop, or an `adb install -r` over the top of a
 * running download. Nothing then runs `finishDownloadNotification`, and an
 * ongoing notification with no process behind it cannot even be swiped
 * away. `clearStaleDownloadNotification` is called once at startup for
 * exactly that: if we are only now booting, no download of ours is
 * running, so any bar in the shade is a ghost.
