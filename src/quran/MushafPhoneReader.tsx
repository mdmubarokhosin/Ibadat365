/**
 * Phone mushaf reader — both orientations, one component
 * (docs/mushaf-reader-split-plan.md, step 2).
 *
 * Grown from `MushafPhoneLandscape`'s FlatList: portrait and landscape are
 * the SAME tree, so rotation never remounts — it only re-derives the page
 * geometry from `useWindowDimensions` (see `phonePageGeometry.ts`):
 *
 * - `pageWidth` = window width (both orientations)
 * - `textWidth` = portrait: width − padding · landscape:
 *   `min(width − padding, height × 1.6)` (the reading zoom — the short
 *   side IS the portrait page width)
 * - the page column scrolls vertically only when the page is taller than
 *   the window (portrait: never — the page is height-fitted so
 *   `lineHeight = available height / lineCount`; landscape: always).
 *
 * The FlatList keeps its index across rotation; `getItemLayout` recomputes
 * from the new width. No zoom clamps, no windowed strip, no image-cache
 * math — this component is only ever mounted on a phone (DEVICE_CLASS,
 * answered once at module scope) in text mode.
 *
 * ── WHAT A PAGE IS ALLOWED TO RE-RENDER FOR ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The list re-renders for every reason the reader does — a turn, a recited
 * ayah, the chrome coming or going, the player appearing — and each of
 * those used to reach every mounted page: `renderItem` closed over the
 * whole core and the current page, so it was a new function every render,
 * and a page's props carried things that belonged to other pages (the
 * playing ayah, the selection) and so changed when THEY changed.
 *
 * A page is a memoised component now, and it is handed only what is its
 * own: the settled geometry, the marks, and the selection, the playing
 * ayah and the finish pill only when they are on it. Everything else on
 * the screen can re-render and the page does not notice.

 *
 * ── WHY A PHONE MUṢḤAF MUST NOT HOLD A NEIGHBOUR AT REST ──────────────
 *
 * The window used to widen to three once the push transition was over —
 * the page being read and a neighbour either side — so the next page was
 * already drawn when the finger moved. Those neighbours are laid out at
 * ±one viewport, just outside the window.
 *
 * Then the phone is turned. The native view is resized to the landscape
 * width in the platform's own layout pass, LONG before React Native has
 * re-rendered anything: the pager's viewport is suddenly twice as wide,
 * its children are still portrait-wide, and its scroll offset is still a
 * multiple of the portrait width. The frame the platform then shows —
 * under its own rotation cross-fade, so it is on screen for the length of
 * that animation — is the current page and its neighbour, side by side.
 * On a phone. Reported, exactly, as looking fragile and unstable.
 *
 * Nothing in JavaScript can beat that frame: it is composed before any of
 * our code runs. What can be done is to make sure there is no second page
 * mounted to reveal. So the window is one at rest, and widens the moment a
 * finger lands on the pager — `onTouchStart`, not the scroll, so the
 * neighbours are drawn during the gap between touching and moving — then
 * narrows again once the reader has been still for a while.
 *
 * (It is also right for OPENING, which is what it was first written for:
 * the first page's font and fifteen lines of text should not share the
 * thread with two more pages' worth under the push transition.)

          Yaseen has no way to ask for it. The rail costs 32pt and answers
          both.

          IT STAYS IN FULLSCREEN. It used to retire with the rest of the

          is how you move through the muṣḥaf — losing it meant fullscreen
          reading was a page at a time or not at all. It is also the only
