/**
 * Font-rendered mushaf page — v2.8.0.
 *
 * Draws a page of the Madinah mushaf as text using that page's own QPC v2
 * font, in place of the 2600×4206 PNG the reader used until now. Vector text
 * is crisp at any size, costs a fraction of the memory, and re-lays out
 * instantly on rotation — and because every word is a real node, tapping a
 * word resolves an ayah directly instead of going through hand-measured
 * coordinate boxes.
 *
 * ## How a page is sized, and how a line is justified
 *
 * `pageMeasureEm()` gives the page's measure: its widest line as DRAWN — the
 * glyph advances plus a nominal space per gap — in ems of its own font.
 * Setting `fontSize = textWidth / measureEm` makes that line span the page
 * exactly, so every page comes out the same physical width even though the
 * 604 fonts are drawn at different design sizes.
 *
 * Every other line is then justified by SOLVING for its space: the gap that
 * makes `natural + gaps × space` equal the measure, held inside the band in
 * `docs/mushaf-fidelity-rules.md`. A line that would need more than the band
 * allows — and the line that closes a surah, which the print never stretches
 * — is set at the nominal space and centred.
 *
 * That only works because the gap is drawn in a font we ship, at a size
 * derived from that font's own space advance (`MUSHAF_SPACE_ADVANCE_EM`). The
 * QPC page fonts carry no space glyph, so a plain space falls back to whatever
 * face the platform picks, at a width we never measured and that differs
 * between iOS and Android. When that width came out wider than the box the
 * line was given, every line of page 49 lost its last word.
 *
 * The other half of that lesson is `MUSHAF_LINE_BOX_SLACK_EM`, reserved out
 * of the page block: Android lays a single line out by BREAKING it, and when
 * nothing in the line is breakable it breaks between glyphs — and a QPC glyph
 * is a whole word. A line one sub-pixel over its box therefore does not clip,
 * it loses a word. The line must simply never be wider than its box.
 *
 * There are no bidi control characters in the paragraph. QPC numbers its
 * glyphs in reading order, so a right-to-left paragraph of bare tokens is
 * already correct; see `lineTokenStream`.
