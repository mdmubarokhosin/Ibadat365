/**
 * Rebuild and push the widget payload FROM THE STORES, with no screen mounted.
 *
 * The payload used to have exactly one writer, and it lived inside
 * `HomeScreen` — two calls to `syncPrayerWidget`, one on focus and one on an
 * effect. Nothing else in the app ever wrote it. That is a structural bug, not
 * a missing feature, and it had teeth:
 *
 *   - The bottom tabs are lazy, so `HomeScreen` only mounts once Today has
 *     been focused. Every deep link the widgets themselves fire —
 *     `ibadat365://log`, `ibadat365://tasbih`, `ibadat365://quran`, `ibadat365://read/:id`
 *     — opens the app WITHOUT mounting it. Tap a widget, do the thing it asked
 *     you to do, and the widget kept its old numbers for the whole session.
 *   - `notifyPracticeChanged()` from the notification actions and the
 *     end-of-day prompt fired into an empty listener set whenever the app was
 *     closed, because the only subscriber was a hook inside that screen.
 *   - The widget tap queues drain at app root, usually finishing AFTER
 *     HomeScreen's first push, so those taps landed in the journal with
 *     nothing scheduled to republish them.
 *
 * So the payload is built here instead, from the same places the app reads
 * everything else: settings, the on-disk prayer cache, and the practice /
 * quran / tasbih stores. `HomeScreen` still pushes — it has a live GPS fix and
 * a freshly reverse-geocoded city name before either has been written back to
 * settings, so its copy is the better one when it exists. This is what makes
 * sure there IS a copy the rest of the time.
 *
 * CACHE-ONLY, then on-device. This never fetches: a republish is triggered by
 * a bead being counted, and a burst of network requests behind a bead is not a
 * trade anyone would make. When the cache has nothing for today — a fresh
 * install, a city the user has just moved to — it falls back to computing the
 * window with adhan.js locally, which is the same safety net the hook uses and
 * is exact enough for a home screen.
