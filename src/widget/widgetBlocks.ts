 * Everything the home-screen widgets read BESIDES prayer times.

 * Six widget kinds need five different slices of app state, and each one of

 * payload the native renderers parse. So the blocks are defined once, here,
 * built by pure functions, and hung off `WidgetPrayerPayload` as optional
 * fields — a renderer that does not know a block simply never looks at it.
 *
 * All of it is OPTIONAL on purpose. The widget process cannot read the
 * encrypted journal blob and must not try: practice data is sensitive, it
 * lives behind `durableEncryptedGet`, and a widget extension has no business
 * holding that key. The app reads it, reduces it to the few numbers a 4x4
 * grid can show, and pushes that. A block is absent when the app has not
 * pushed it yet, which every renderer must treat as "do not draw the
 * section" rather than as zero — a streak of 0 and an unknown streak look
 * identical on screen and mean opposite things.

 * across the full width of a 4x3: seven rows of fourteen columns is a 2:1
 * shape in a box three times as wide as it is tall, so the graph sat in the

 * takes as many as fit at full size rather than stretching what it has.

 * to spare, and a card whose chrome measured a few dp shorter would have
