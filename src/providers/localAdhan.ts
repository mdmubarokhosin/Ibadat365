// ── METHOD IDS ARE ALADHAN'S, AND SO ARE THE ANGLES ───────────────────
//
// `calculationMethod` is an AlAdhan method id everywhere in this app: the
// picker stores it, `aladhan.ts` forwards it verbatim, and this file is
// what computes with it when the network is gone. So the two must agree,
// or a user's times change depending on whether they have signal.
//
// They did not agree. This switch mapped several named methods onto some
// OTHER method's angles, silently:
//
//   id  method                        was              should be
//    0  Shia Ithna-Ashari, Qum        Tehran 17.7/14   16/14, Maghrib +16
//    8  Gulf Region                   Dubai 18.2/18.2  19.5/90-min Isha
//   12  Union Org. Islamic de France  MWL 18/17        12/12
//   14  Spiritual Adm. of Russia      Moonsighting     16/15
//   21  Morocco                       (absent → MWL)   19/17, Dhuhr+5 Maghrib+5
//
// Morocco is the one that got reported (issue #10, "prayer times in my
// location are a bit off by minutes"), and only because AlAdhan already
// auto-selects Morocco for Moroccan coordinates — so the gap showed only
// when someone picked a method by hand or dropped to this file offline.
// The others are the same bug, unreported.
//
// Every set of numbers below was checked against AlAdhan's own output for
// a city that uses it, on 2026-08-30, and they agree to the minute on
// Fajr, Sunrise, Dhuhr, Maghrib and Isha. `__tests__/calculationMethods.test.ts`
// keeps those readings.
//
// Morocco is the one deliberate exception, and it is checked against
// something better: a month of the ministry's own published table. AlAdhan
// is a very good secondary source, but where it and the authority a method
// is named after disagree, the authority wins. See the case below.
//
// Two things that table does NOT say, and which /methods will not tell
// you either — both found by comparing real output rather than reading
// the docs:
//
//   • Morocco publishes Dhuhr and Maghrib with a five-minute margin. Set
//     19/17 alone and those two are five minutes early, which is exactly
//     the complaint being fixed.
//   • Shia Ithna-Ashari holds Maghrib until the redness goes, +16 minutes
//     past sunset.
//
// Known residual: adhan.js computes Asr one to two minutes before AlAdhan
// does, for EVERY method including the presets. It is a shadow-length
// rounding difference, not a parameter, and it is left alone here rather
// than papered over per-method.
