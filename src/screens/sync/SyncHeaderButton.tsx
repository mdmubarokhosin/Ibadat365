/**
 * Sync, from the screen showing the data that would travel.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT ALWAYS THERE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It appears only once sync would actually do something — a folder AND a
 * paired device. Before that the same two screens carry a pointer offering
 * to set it up, and having both at once would be the app asking twice for
 * one thing. After that the pointer is gone and this takes its place.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS WORTH A HEADER SLOT AT ALL ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * The rounds that matter are the ones someone asks for: they logged Fajr on
 * their phone and want it on the tablet before they put the phone down.
 * Sending them to Settings to do that is three taps away from the screen
 * they are already looking at, and the automatic round on app open cannot
 * help with something they did thirty seconds ago.
 *
 * It reports the same three outcomes as the Sync screen, in the same words,
 * because a round that found nothing must not be called "Synced" here and
 * something else there.
