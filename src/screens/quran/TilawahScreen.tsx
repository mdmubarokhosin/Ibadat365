/**
 * Listening — the Quran as something you put on, not something you read.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT THE READER ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The reader already plays audio, and for a long time that was the only
 * way to hear anything: open the mushaf, tap an ayah, "play from here".
 * That flow is about the passage in front of you, and it ends where the
 * surah does, because you asked for that surah.
 *
 * Listening is a different act. Someone puts a recitation on in the car,
 * or at night with the screen off, and expects what any player does — one
 * surah into the next, controls on the lock screen, and no need for the
 * app to be open or even alive. Building that into the reader would have
 * meant a page that is sometimes a book and sometimes a stereo. So it is
 * its own page, and the pieces underneath — the queue, the store, the
 * downloaded files — are shared rather than duplicated.
 *
 * ── THE FILES ARE THE SAME FILES ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Downloaded recitation lives in `<Documents>/quran/audio/{reciter}/`,
 * which is exactly where the reader's prefetch writes and exactly where
 * its player looks. Downloading a reciter to listen to on a flight makes
 * the mushaf's play-from-here work offline in the same act, and someone
 * who has been reading with recitation for a month finds that download
 * already part-done. One folder, one answer to "do I have this".
 *
 * Which is why the download is not on this page. It used to be: a card
 * under the transport, "Keep <name> on this device", sized and buttoned
 * — one card describing one reciter, the selected one, sitting between
 * the player and the surah list on every visit whether or not anything
 * was ever downloaded. "Which voices do I have offline?" was a question
 * about forty-two reciters answered one selection at a time. It belongs
 * on the list of reciters, so that is where it went: see
 * `ReciterPickerSheet`.
