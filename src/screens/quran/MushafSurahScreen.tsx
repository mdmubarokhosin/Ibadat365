/**
 * The muṣḥaf, as a screen: the page reader plus everything the navigator
 * needs to know to hold it — the header controls, the page-coloured
 * chrome, fullscreen, orientation, and the one gesture the Mac has to
 * give up.
 *
 * Until 2 September this and the translation reader were one 980-line
 * screen switching on `isMushaf` in its header effect, its content style,
 * its sheets and its render. Every muṣḥaf concern — the riwayah chip, the
 * fullscreen button, the page-derived title, the night-mode header tint,
 * the trackpad gesture — was a branch inside something the translation
 * reader also ran. They share a route and a toggle, and that is all they
 * share; `QuranSurahScreen` is the route now, and this is the muṣḥaf.
