/**
 * The practice graph, on Home, behind a switch.
 *
 * Home answers "when do I pray next"; the graph answers "how have I been
 * doing", and those are different questions on different clocks — which is
 * why this is off by default and why the toggle sits next to the graph on
 * the Log tab as well as in Settings. For the people who do want it, seeing
 * the squares on the screen they open twenty times a day is the entire
 * point of keeping the record at all.
 *
 * The squares themselves are not controls — no day selection, no legend, no
 * caption; a legend repeated on two screens is furniture, and per-square
 * selection here would mean two graphs behaving differently. But the card
 * opens the Log, because a picture of your record that does nothing when you
 * press it reads as broken: people press it precisely because they want the
 * thing it is a picture OF.
 *
 * That press lives on a ROW at the foot of the card, not on the card itself.
 * Wrapping the whole card in a Pressable put a press target around a
 * horizontally scrolling grid, and the two fought for every gesture: the
 * graph would not scroll here at all, which is a strange thing for the same
 * component to do on one screen and not the other. The row is also the
 * app's own idiom for this — "All upcoming →" on the Log does the same job.
