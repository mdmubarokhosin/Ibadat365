/**
 * The Qibla, in the corner of the hero.
 *
 * The compass screen has existed and worked this whole time — route
 * registered, deep link `qibla`, dial, announcer, the lot. What it lost
 * was its way in: the tile that opened it was removed with the quick
 * actions grid and nothing replaced it, so a working screen became
 * reachable only by typing a URL.
 *
 * A chip rather than another row: the bearing is a single number that
 * does not change unless the user moves, so it wants the smallest piece
 * of furniture that can carry a number and a tap target. Showing the
 * degrees on the chip itself is most of the feature — someone who
 * already knows which way is north never has to open anything.
 *
 * ── WHY `onPress` IS OPTIONAL ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On a Mac there is no magnetometer, so there is no compass screen to
 * open — but the BEARING is not a device measurement, it is spherical
 * trigonometry on two coordinates, and it is just as true on a desktop
 * as on a phone. So the chip stays there and stops being a button: a
 * readout rather than a door to a room that does not exist.
 *
 * The degrees are TRUE north, the same frame `qiblaBearingFrom` computes
 * in and the same one both compass modules report headings in.

          A compass rose and "116°" is a puzzle: the icon is small, the
          number could be a temperature, and nothing on the chip says what
          it is a bearing TO. Screen readers were told — `qiblaChipA11y`
          has always read "Qibla 116 degrees" — and everyone looking at it
          had to already know.
