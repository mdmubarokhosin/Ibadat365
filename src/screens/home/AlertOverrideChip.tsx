/**
 * "This one time is not what you set it to" — and the way back.
 *
 * The Live Activity's button can put the upcoming prayer on a different
 * alert for that occurrence only. Before this, the home row went on
 * showing the standing setting: silence Fajr from the lock screen at
 * midnight, open the app, and the row still said Adhan. The app held two
 * answers about the same prayer and offered no way to reconcile them —
 * which is the complaint the three-mode button was built to answer, in
 * reverse.
 *
 * So the row now shows what will ACTUALLY happen at that time, and this
 * line under the name is what stops that from reading as a permanent
 * change: it names the exception, and pressing it takes the exception
 * away.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS UNDER THE NAME AND NOT BESIDE THE TIME ─────────────────
 *
 * The trailing edge of a row is a column, not a place: the control, the
 * chosen-dot's held slot and the time are aligned across every row of the
 * card, and this file's neighbours go to some length to keep them that
 * way — the dot's slot is drawn even when there is no dot, and the time
 * column is sized by the longest time on the card rather than its own.
 * A control that appears on ONE row would push that row's bell and time
 * out of line with the other six, which is the exact defect both of those
 * mechanisms exist to prevent. The name column flexes, so a second line
 * under the name costs nothing anybody is scanning — the same argument
 * the Mālikī boundary line already makes two lines further up.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT SAYS BOTH THINGS ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Reset" alone does not say why the row looks wrong. "Just this once"
 * alone does not offer a way out. A reader who has never seen this before
 * needs the pair, in that order: what happened, then what to do about it.
 * It NAMES the mode rather than leaning on the bell beside it, because
 * on tomorrow's card there is no bell: the cycling control only appears
 * on today's, since a tap there changes every Fajr rather than one. An
 * override set after Isha belongs to tomorrow's Fajr, so this line has to
 * stand on its own. Two lines are allowed for it — the languages that
 * need a whole clause for "just this once" should wrap rather than
 * ellipsise away the half that says what to do.
