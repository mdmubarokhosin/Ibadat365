// tokens-ok: the sky's own colours — a drawn scene with its own ink, not app chrome
/**
 * The sky behind the countdown — one continuous day, drawn from the clock.
 *
 * ── FIVE PASSAGES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The sky is not a set of pictures chosen by the next prayer; it is one
 * scene that moves with the time of day, in five passages that meet at the
 * prayer times themselves:
 *
 *   Isha → Fajr      night. The moon crosses the top of the card, drawn in
 *                    its actual phase — one of the eight — for today.
 *   Fajr → Sunrise   dawn. From the dark of Fajr through the saturated
 *                    rose and orange of the horizon to the peach of first
 *                    light; the sun rises into the card near the end.
 *   Sunrise → Asr    the day. The sun climbs to its height about Dhuhr and
 *                    starts down; the sky goes from morning gold through
 *                    bright noon blue to the warmth of the afternoon.
 *   Asr → Maghrib    sunset. Deepening orange and red as the sun sinks,
 *                    until it has set completely at Maghrib.
 *   Maghrib → Isha   dusk. The afterglow darkens through purple into the
 *                    night that begins at Isha; the stars come out.
 *
 * Each passage is a run of colour KEYFRAMES interpolated by how far the
 * clock has come through it, so the card changes minute by minute and is
 * never seen to jump.
 *
 * ── THE SKY IS TRUE TO THE HOUR, NOT TO THE THEME ─────────────────────
 *
 * Painted at full strength whatever the theme or Material You has done to
 * the accent: night is dark at night in a light app, noon is bright at
 * noon in a dark one. So the hero's TEXT cannot come from the theme either.
 * `skyInkAt` picks the ink for an element from the sky's own colour at
 * that element's height — pure white where the sky is dark, pure black
 * where it is light, with the switch at a luminance where BOTH inks meet
 * WCAG AA (4.5:1): pure white on L = 0.18 is 4.56, pure black on it 4.6.
 * Anything softer than pure fails at the crossing, which is exactly the
 * moment a dawn passes through. The accent stays out of it: on the hero
 * the countdown is the ink, and its size is its rank.
 *
 * Pure functions throughout; the component only draws what `skyFrame`
 * returns.
