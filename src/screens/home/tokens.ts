/**
 * Local design tokens for HomeScreen and its children — task #8.
 *
 * Co-located here so the split-out children can share constants without going
 * through HomeScreen as a prop. Will migrate to the global design system in
 * task #34.
 *
 * Radii unified across platforms and softened (was 16/12 on Android) for a
 * sleeker, more premium feel — generous rounding reads calmer and matches the
 * iOS rounding so both platforms share one visual language.
