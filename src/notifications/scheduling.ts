/**
 * How this app puts a notification on a clock — in one place, because
 * two writers now do it.
 *
 * The scheduler owns the whole set and rewrites it wholesale. The Live
 * Activity's alert-mode button owns exactly one alert and rewrites that
 * from a headless task, with the app closed. Both are creating the same
 * kind of thing at the same kind of moment, and until this module existed
 * they disagreed about how: the scheduler rode AlarmManager with the
 * exact type when the permission was granted and the inexact
 * allow-while-idle type otherwise, and the task passed a hand-written
 * `{ allowWhileIdle: true }` that asked for neither.
 *
 * That is not a cosmetic difference. A prayer re-created by the card's
 * button could be scheduled less punctually than the same prayer
 * scheduled a minute earlier by the app — the one thing the comment
 * inside `buildTimestampTrigger` says must not happen, on the platform it
 * says it about.
 *
 * Extracted rather than exported from `prayerNotifications` because that
 * module already imports the override out of `adhanMute`, and importing
 * the trigger back the other way would close a cycle between the two.
