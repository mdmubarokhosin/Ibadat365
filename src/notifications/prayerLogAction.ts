/**
 * "Log prayer" on a prayer-time notification — the half that writes.
 *
 * The action has been on the notification since v2.4, and it did nothing to
 * the journal. Pressing it ran a handler in LogScreen that highlighted the
 * matching row for four seconds, which is useful only if the Log tab happens
 * to be mounted and the app is in the foreground — and someone pressing a
 * button on a notification is by definition not looking at the Log tab. With
 * the app backgrounded or closed, the press did nothing at all: the button
 * dismissed itself and the prayer stayed unlogged. Reported 2026-08-07.
 *
 * So the press now writes the entry itself, from the background handler,
 * exactly as the end-of-day reminder's action does. The highlight in
 * LogScreen stays for the case where the screen IS open — it now marks a row
 * that has just been filled in rather than one the user still has to fill.
 *
 * ── Which day it lands on ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The date travels in the notification, and the write goes to THAT date, not
 * to whatever day it is when the button is pressed. Isha fires at 23:40 in a
 * Swedish winter and is answered at 00:05; "today" would then credit the
 * wrong day and leave the real one blank. The id (`pt-<epochMs>-<Prayer>`)
 * carries the same instant, so a payload lost to a cold start still resolves.
 *
 * ── Why 'on-time' ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The button is pressed while the notification is on screen, which is to say
 * within the prayer's own window. Recording anything else would be inventing
 * a claim the user did not make; someone who prayed late will open the app
 * and say so, and this entry is editable like any other.
