/**
 * Morning and evening adhkār reminders.
 *
 * The two sets of duas that are not said whenever you think of them —
 * they belong to a window in the day, and the window is defined by the
 * sun rather than by the clock:
 *
 *   • Morning — after Fajr, before sunrise.
 *   • Evening — after ʿAṣr, before sunset.
 *
 * Which is why this cannot be the ayah-of-the-day pattern with a picker.
 * "07:30" is the right time for morning adhkār in Stockholm in November
 * and two hours after sunrise in June; the same number cannot be both,
 * and asking someone to keep re-picking it as the year turns is asking
 * them to do the app's arithmetic. So there is no time to choose: a
 * toggle, and the time comes from the day's own prayer times.
 *
 * ── WHERE IN THE WINDOW ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not at its start: a notification that arrives while you are praying is
 * an interruption of the thing it is reminding you about. Not at its end
 * either — a reminder that lands as the window closes is a reproach.
 * `OFFSET_MINUTES` after the opening prayer, which is about when the
 * prayer is finished and the phone is picked up again.
 *
 * That offset is a preference, not a promise, and the window wins: at 60°
 * north in June, Fajr to sunrise is a matter of minutes, and a fixed
 * twenty would put the morning reminder after the window it names. So
 * the time is clamped to end a little before the window closes, and a
 * window too short to hold even that gets no notification at all rather
 * than a wrong one. The same arithmetic in reverse never happens for the
 * evening — ʿAṣr to sunset is hours — but it is written once and used by
 * both, because "it cannot happen" is how the polar-latitude bugs in
 * this app have always started.
 *
 * Scheduling mirrors `endOfDayLog.ts`: stable ids, one TIMESTAMP trigger
 * per day over the cached week, cancelled and rebuilt on every resync.
 * The times come from the same `week` + `baseDate` the prayer alerts use,
 * which is the only place in the app holding real times for future days
 * anchored to the day they were fetched for.
