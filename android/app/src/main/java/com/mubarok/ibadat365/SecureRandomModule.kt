/**
 * Cryptographically secure random bytes, for the sync keypair.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. React Native ships no WebCrypto — there is no
 * `crypto.getRandomValues` in Hermes — and `Math.random` is a PRNG seeded
 * from things that are often guessable. A keypair generated from
 * `Math.random` is not a weak keypair, it is a public one, so this is not a
 * corner that can be cut with something plausible-looking.
 *
 * WHY NOT A LIBRARY. `react-native-get-random-values` does this in about
 * forty lines of native code. Taking it means an entry in node_modules,
 * which means another `scanignore` line in the F-Droid recipe, which since
 * the merge lives in `fdroiddata` and needs a fresh MR and a review. App
 * source needs none of that, and this app already carries eight hand-written
 * native modules.
 *
 * ONE INSTANCE, NOT ONE PER CALL. `SecureRandom()` seeds itself on
 * construction, and on Android that can block on the entropy pool the first
 * time. Holding one and reusing it keeps the cost to the first call of the
 * process rather than paying it per keypair — and reusing a properly seeded
 * CSPRNG is exactly what it is designed for.
 *
 * NO `setSeed`. It is tempting to stir in the clock or a device id for
 * "extra" entropy; on Android that is at best useless and was historically
 * harmful, since some implementations REPLACED the seed rather than mixing.
 * The platform default is seeded from the kernel and is the right answer.
