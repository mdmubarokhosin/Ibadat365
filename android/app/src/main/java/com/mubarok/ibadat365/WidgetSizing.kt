/**
 * ONE RemoteViews THAT IS RIGHT AT EVERY SIZE THE LAUNCHER MAY SHOW.
 *
 * ── THE BUG CLASS THIS ENDS ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every widget here decides what to draw from its size: whether the header
 * fits, whether the graph appears, how big the times can be. Until now
 * each provider read that size out of `getAppWidgetOptions` at draw time
 * and produced ONE RemoteViews for it. Two things are wrong with that, and
 * both have reached users:
 *
 *   • The options carry a size per ORIENTATION, paired under names that
 *     read like a range (MIN/MAX). A card drawn upright from the landscape
 *     height lost its header; a card drawn for portrait and then rotated
 *     kept the wrong variant until the next redraw — and the launcher does
 *     not redraw on rotation, it re-lays-out what it was given.
 *   • Some launchers (EMUI among them) hand out sizes the provider was
 *     never tuned against, and a threshold that is "mid-band" on a Pixel
 *     lands on the wrong side of a row there.
 *
 * Android 12 fixed this at the platform: a provider can hand the launcher
 * a MAP from sizes to RemoteViews, one for each size the widget can take
 * (`OPTION_APPWIDGET_SIZES`), and the launcher picks the entry for the size
 * it is actually drawing — per orientation, per resize, without asking the
 * provider again. The provider's job becomes a pure function of (width,
 * height), which is what every `bind*` here already was.
 *
 * ── HOW TO USE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     appWidgetManager.updateAppWidget(id, WidgetSizing.responsive(context, mgr, id) { size ->
 *       buildViews(context, ..., size.widthDp, size.heightDp)
 *     })
 *
 * On API 31+ with sizes reported, `render` runs once per size (at most 16,
 * the platform's cap) and the launcher does the choosing. Otherwise it
 * runs once, for the single best guess `PrayerWidgetProvider.sizeDp` makes
 * — the pre-12 behaviour, unchanged.
 *
 * `render` MUST be a pure function of its size argument: no reading the
 * options bundle, no `sizeDp`, inside it. A render that peeks at the
 * options for the "current" size defeats the whole mechanism.
