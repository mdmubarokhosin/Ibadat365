   *
   * The button used to broadcast ACTION_APPWIDGET_UPDATE, which redrew the
   * same stored bytes and nothing else. That is a defensible reading of
   * "refresh" and not the one anybody has: a person taps it because what
   * they are looking at is not what they expect, and on a paired phone the

   * also the only way to sync without opening the app — auto-sync runs while

   * the app.
   *
   * Wrapped, because a HeadlessJS service can be refused: the process may be
   * starting, or the OS may be in a state that forbids it. A refresh that
   * only redraws is the old behaviour, which is worse than the new one and
   * much better than a crash inside a broadcast receiver.
   *
   * NOT WHAT THE SAME GLYPH DOES ON iOS. `RefreshIntent` over in
   * PrayerWidgetExtension.swift calls `reloadTimelines(ofKind:)` and stops
   * there: an iOS widget extension has no way to run a sync round, because
   * the round needs the record's encryption key and the key lives on the
   * JS side of the app. Android can do the second half only because a
   * HeadlessJS service is a way to run that JS without a foreground app.
   * So the two buttons genuinely mean different things, and the gap is not
   * an unfinished port.

     * The old constants (132 for the content, 145 and 110 for the two
     * thresholds) were measured in August against the card, when the card
     * WAS the host view. `widget_card_inset` then gave every widget a 6dp
     * gutter on all four sides so two cards in adjacent cells could not
     * touch — 12dp of height that the layout no longer has and that none of
     * these numbers were told about. Everything downstream inherited the
     * error: a card was called roomy 12dp before it was, and the leftover
     * handed to `slack` was 12dp more than existed. LinearLayout does not
     * report an overflow, it takes it out of the last child, so on any phone
     * whose launcher row is around 147dp — every 480dpi Pixel — the strip
     * drew its full-height variant into a card 12dp too short and the
     * next-prayer line came out as a 7dp sliver of clipped text.
     *
     * So: measured on the device, host-view relative, at 480dpi. 12dp of
     * inset, 28 or 12dp of root padding, the header row at 19, the six
     * columns at 40, the rule and its two margins at 17, the next-prayer
     * line at 19, and the night row's margin at 4. Each is rounded UP —
     * `slack` is spent on padding, and padding that overshoots is exactly
     * how the footer went off the bottom.
     *
     * They are budgets and thresholds at once, which is the point: the
     * variant is chosen by asking which budget fits, and the slack is the
     * leftover against THAT SAME budget. A variant can no longer be picked
