/**
 * Copy and paste, for the pairing code.
 *
 * WHY NOT `Clipboard` FROM REACT NATIVE. It is still there in 0.83 and it
 * still works, behind a deprecation warning that says it will be removed. A
 * headline feature resting on an API whose own runtime warns it is leaving
 * is a fault waiting for an upgrade to trigger, and the fix would have to be
 * written then instead of now.
 *
 * WHY NOT `@react-native-clipboard/clipboard`. It is the recommended
 * replacement and it is fine — but it is native code in node_modules, which
 * means another `scanignore` line in the F-Droid recipe, which lives in
 * `fdroiddata` and needs its own merge request and review. The whole pairing
 * design was arranged to avoid that for the first release. Forty lines of
 * app source needs none of it.
 *
 * NOT MARKED SENSITIVE. Android 13 will hide the preview of a clip flagged
 * with `EXTRA_IS_SENSITIVE`, which is right for a password and wrong here:
 * the pairing code IS the device's public key, it sits on screen
 * permanently, and someone copying it usually wants to see that they copied
 * the right one.
