/**
 * A THROW IN A WIDGET RENDER BECOMES A MIHRAB CARD, NEVER THE LAUNCHER'S.
 *
 * When a provider's `onUpdate` throws, the launcher shows its own generic
 * "Can't load widget" — no class name, no log line from us, and (as #31
 * proved) no way to learn from a phone nobody here owns what went wrong.
 * The Next-prayer and Sky cards already catch their own render and put the
 * exception's class name on the card; this is the same guard for every
 * other provider, so the whole family degrades the same way.
 *
 * `render` is the provider's real drawing. If it throws, the card is a
 * plain Mihrab card — the user's background, the standard inset — with the
 * placeholder line reading "Couldn't load widget (SomeException)" in the
 * error red. The class name is enough to diagnose from a screenshot; the
 * message stays out of the card (it can carry payload content, and a
 * widget on a lock screen is not the place for it) and goes to the log.
 *
 * Only exceptions are caught. An Error (OutOfMemory, a stack overflow) is
 * not a rendering fault and should surface as one.
