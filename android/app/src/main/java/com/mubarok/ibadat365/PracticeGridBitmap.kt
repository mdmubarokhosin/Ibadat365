/**
 * The practice graph, drawn once into a Bitmap.
 *
 * RemoteViews has a fixed view vocabulary and no loops: seventy squares means
 * seventy TextViews declared by hand in XML, each addressed by a generated id,
 * and every update crossing the process boundary as seventy separate actions.
 * A Bitmap is one action and one object, and the drawing is a dozen lines.
 *
 * THE GRID IS A CALENDAR, NOT A LIST. `practice.days` is SPARSE — the payload
 * writer omits days with nothing recorded and stamps every entry it does send
 * with its own date (`d`), because a dense ninety-eight-day array costs more
 * than the payload budget allows. This used to walk the array positionally and
 * pack entry `i` into cell `i`, which is only ever right for an unbroken run:
 * one skipped day slid every square after it one place along, and the widget
 * drew a record the Log screen had never shown. Look the day up by its date,
 * the way iOS's PracticeGrid does, and a gap is a gap.
 *
 * A RUN OF DAYS, READ LIKE A SENTENCE. It was seven rows of week-columns —
 * the shape the in-app heatmap uses — and on a home screen that shape costs
 * more than it returns: seven rows in the height a card can spare makes
 * every day a speck, and to reach the card's far edge it takes six months of
 * them, so the graph was mostly a wall of history nobody was looking at,
 * drawn too small to read. The days run left to right now and wrap like
 * text, the last cell is today, and the cell is big enough to have a mark on
 * it that means something. The weekly rhythm is gone; on a surface with no
 * legend and no tap, being able to see last week at all is worth more.
 *
 * THE WIDTH DECIDES THE CELL AND THE HEIGHT DECIDES THE ROWS. Those are the
 * two things a card can say about its shape, and the one it can say
 * accurately is its width — the height it reports is the launcher's figure
 * for the host view less whatever chrome the card believes it draws. So the
 * cell is the width divided among as many columns as fit, which lands the
 * grid flush on both edges whatever the height turns out to be, and the
 * height only decides how many rows of that cell there is room for. Shrink
 * the card and it loses a row rather than shrinking every day in it. The
 * few dp the last row does not divide into are given back to the rows, up
 * to an eighth of a cell, so the graph fills the box instead of floating
 * in a band of empty card at each end.
 *
 * FOUR CHANNELS, the same four the Log screen uses: fill depth for the
 * prayers, an outer amber ring for a completed fast, an inset gold line for
 * how much sunnah the day held, and a grey corner dot for a day inside the
 * record that was never filled in. Anything the app draws in a fifth
 * channel — the qiyam mark, the selection — is left out: a home screen has
 * no legend and no tap, and a mark nobody can decode is noise.
 *
 * The ramp is the same one SwiftUI's PracticeGrid uses:
 * `alpha = 0.42 + 0.58 * (kept / 5)` on the accent, so one prayer is faintly
 * there rather than invisible and five is solid. A missed day is the danger
 * colour at low alpha — a different KIND of day, not a fainter good one.

   * The grid's whole geometry for a given box — how many days, and the

   *
   * ── ONE PLACE, BECAUSE TWO WAS THE BUG ────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The count and the cell size used to be decided by different code: a
   * cell size derived from the box's HEIGHT chose the column count, and
   * then the caller drew that count at a size of its own. Two shapes with
   * no reason to agree, and on a 4x4 they did not — the bitmap came out
   * proportionally narrower than its ImageView, `fitStart` scaled it to the
   * height, and eighty-odd pixels of width piled up on the right. A graph
   * that stops short of the edge every other element reaches does not read
   * as a graph that chose to be narrow; it reads as one being clipped.
   *
   * So it is answered once, here, and the caller passes the answer straight
   * through to `render`.
   *
   * ── AND WHICH WAY TO BE WRONG ─────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * `boxHeightDp` is an estimate: the caller subtracts the chrome it knows
   * about from the height the launcher reports for the host view, and the
   * ImageView's real height comes out a little under it. So the box is
   * reckoned SHORTER than it measured. Too many columns costs a few percent
   * of cell width with the slack falling under the grid, where nothing is
   * looking; too few costs the gap against the right edge. Being wrong in
   * one direction is a rounding error and in the other it is the bug.
