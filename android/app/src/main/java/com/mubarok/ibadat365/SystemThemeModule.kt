 *     after the Material You toggle so PlatformColor refs are torn
 *     down and re-resolved against the new theme.
 *
 *   • resolveAccentHex()      — reads `?attr/colorPrimary` from the

 *     SVG icons can't consume PlatformColor; this gives them a hex
 *     that matches the live system accent under Material You.
