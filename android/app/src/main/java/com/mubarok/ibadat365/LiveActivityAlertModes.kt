/**
 * How the upcoming event announces itself, and what one tap on the card
 * changes it to.
 *
 * This is the native half of `src/settings/alertModes.ts`. The home rows
 * cycle a prayer through adhan → alert → silent; the Live Activity's
 * action button is now the same control, so the two have to agree about
 * three things — which modes a row may hold, what order they cycle in,
 * and that Sunrise and the night marks never reach the adhan. They are
 * stated once on each side and pinned against each other by
 * `__tests__/liveActivityAlertCycle.test.ts`, because a mismatch here
 * would not fail a build: it would just make the button do something
 * different from the row above it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE MODE TRAVELS ON EVERY ROW ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The card advances to the next event by itself, in the foreground
 * service, with no JS running — that is the whole reason it can count
 * down for a day without the app being opened. So the payload cannot
 * say "the next one is set to X": within minutes that sentence is about
 * the previous prayer. Every row of every day carries its own `mode`
 * instead, and the lookup below is by key, which is safe precisely
 * because a mode belongs to the prayer rather than to the day.
 *
 * ── AND WHY THE OVERRIDE IS AN OCCURRENCE, NOT A NAME ───────────────
 *
 * The button is temporary by design: it speaks for THIS Fajr and not for
 * Fajr. What identifies "this Fajr" was the instant, and an instant is
 * the one thing about a prayer that is not fixed — the time is recomputed
 * whenever its inputs move, and the override, pinned to the old
 * millisecond, then matched nothing. Failing quietly would be one thing;
 * this failed loudly, because no match means the prayer falls back to its
 * standing setting and that is usually the adhan.
 *
 * So it is the event and the local day it falls on: "Fajr, on the
 * eighth", which is what the user meant and which survives the clock time
 * underneath being recalculated. The epoch is still carried, for
 * scheduling — but it no longer decides anything.
