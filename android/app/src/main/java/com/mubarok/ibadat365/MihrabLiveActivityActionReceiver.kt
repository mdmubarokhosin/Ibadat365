/**
 * Handles the Live Activity's action buttons (Android 17+).
 *
 * The alert-mode button was a two-state "Mute next adhan" toggle. It is now
 * the same three-way control as the home row — adhan / alert / silent, one
 * tap per step, for the upcoming occurrence only. See
 * [LiveActivityAlertModes] for why the mode travels on every row and why the
 * override is stored against an instant.
 *
 * The Live Activity is a native Notification.Builder (not notifee), so its
 * action button fires a broadcast here. We split responsibility:
 *
 *   • Native owns the BUTTON STATE — the override (an instant and a mode) is
 *     stored in the Live Activity SharedPreferences and read back by the
 *     notification builder to choose the label. This makes the label advance
 *     instantly and reliably, even with no JS runtime alive.
 *
 *   • JS owns the ACTUAL ALERT — the adhan is an OS-played
 *     notification-channel sound baked into a pre-scheduled notifee trigger,
 *     so changing the mode means re-creating that trigger on another channel,
 *     or cancelling it outright for silent. That's JS work, dispatched to
 *     [AdhanMuteHeadlessService] (a HeadlessJS task) which runs even when the
 *     app is closed. The task also persists the override so a later full
 *     resync rebuilds the alert the way the button left it.
 *
 * The two are independent: if the JS side fails, the button still advances and
 * the Live Activity itself is never affected.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES THE STANDING SETTING. The home row is the answer for
 * every Fajr; this is the answer for one of them, and a temporary control
 * that quietly turns permanent is the worst of both.
