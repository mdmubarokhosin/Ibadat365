/**
 * Restarts the Live Activity foreground service after an app update or
 * device reboot, so the user doesn't need to open the app to get the
 * notification back.
 *
 * Handles two intents:
 *
 *   MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED — fired immediately after this app's APK is
 *     replaced during an OTA update. The old process has already been
 *     killed; this receiver runs in the freshly-installed process.
 *
 *   BOOT_COMPLETED — fired after a full device boot. All foreground
 *     services are dead; we revive the Live Activity if it was active
 *     before the shutdown.
 *
 * Both cases read the payload that was persisted to SharedPreferences by
 * MihrabLiveActivityModule.display() and restart the service with it.
 * If the user had explicitly cancelled (MihrabLiveActivityModule.cancel()
 * clears the prefs), this receiver is a no-op.
 *
 * The RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission is already declared in the
 * manifest (added for the widget receivers). MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED does
 * not require a special permission.
