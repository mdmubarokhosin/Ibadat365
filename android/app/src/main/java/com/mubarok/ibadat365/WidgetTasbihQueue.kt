 * in the app's own storage, which a widget process cannot reach — but with
 * one difference that changes the rules: a journal entry is a SET and a
 * dhikr count is a SEQUENCE. Tapping Fajr twice means Fajr; tapping +1 twice
 * means two. So nothing is de-duplicated and order is the answer.

   * Dhikr arrives in runs — a set is thirty-three beads — and this process
   * has no store of its own, so every tap read the whole queue back out of
   * shared preferences, parsed it, appended, re-serialized ALL of it and
   * rewrote the file, and then the redraw parsed it again to project the
   * number. Measured on an emulator: 47ms a tap on an empty queue and 182ms
   * near the cap, and a phone is slower. Tapping at any speed then backs the
   * broadcast queue up behind a receiver that cannot keep pace, which is how
   * a slow widget becomes "Mihrab isn't responding".
   *
   * A run is one record whose count goes up, so bead three thousand costs
   * what bead one did. `at` is the run's NEWEST tap, so a sitting that
   * crosses the fortnight cutoff is not thrown away while it is still being
   * counted.
