/**
 * Log Today — the one widget that changes what the app IS from the home
 * screen rather than being a better way to read something already readable.
 *
 * Five chips, one per salāh. Tapping a due one records it; tapping it again
 * within the undo window takes it back. Everything else opens the app: the
 * widget can express "prayed on time" and nothing more, and a control that
 * silently records a status the user did not choose is worse than one that
 * hands them the screen where they can choose it.
 *
 * ── What it draws, and from where ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two sources, merged. The `today` block of the payload is what the JOURNAL
 * says, and the queue is what has been TAPPED since the app last ran. A chip
 * is ticked if either says so, which is what lets the tick land on the tap
 * instead of on the next app launch. See widgetLogQueue.ts for why the tap
 * cannot write the journal directly.
