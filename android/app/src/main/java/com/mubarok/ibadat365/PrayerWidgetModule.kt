      //
      // Redrawing at 1 draws the one state in which the tap exists NOWHERE:
      // gone from the queue the widget projects, absent from the payload it
      // projects onto. So the number fell back to what it was before the
      // tap — to zero on a counter that had just been started, or to the
      // previous dhikr's count after Next — and stayed there for as long as
      // 2 and 3 took. Reported as "the count becomes zero for a second and
      // then reacts to the button".
      //
      // The redraw was also never needed. Step 3 ends in `setData`, which
      // fans `requestUpdate` out to every widget kind including this one, so
      // the correct redraw already happens at the only moment it is correct.
