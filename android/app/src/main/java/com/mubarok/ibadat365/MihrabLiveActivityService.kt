/**
 * Mihrab Live Activity foreground service.
 *
 * Why a foreground service: the OS keeps the app process alive while
 * the service is up, so our internal Handler can re-post the rich
 * notification once a minute and the progress bar actually advances
 * without anyone opening the app.
 *
 * Dual-notification architecture (v2.1.0-beta.10+):
 *
 *   Notification A — FGS placeholder (FGS_NOTIF_ID, mihrab_fgs_v1 channel,
 *     IMPORTANCE_MIN): posted via startForeground(). This satisfies
 *     Android's foreground-service requirement and keeps the process alive.
 *     It is intentionally silent and hidden — users never see it.
 *
 *   Notification B — rich chip notification (NOTIF_ID, mihrab_live_activity_v3
 *     channel, IMPORTANCE_HIGH): posted via regular notify(). Because it is
 *     NOT the FGS notification, NMS does NOT add FLAG_FOREGROUND_SERVICE to
 *     it, which means NMS CAN set FLAG_PROMOTED_ONGOING on it — making it
 *     eligible for the Android 16 status-bar Live Update chip.
 *
 * KEY INSIGHT (confirmed by inspecting EasyPark's live StatusBarNotification):
 *   FLAG_PROMOTED_ONGOING and FLAG_FOREGROUND_SERVICE are mutually exclusive.
 *   NMS only promotes regular notify() notifications to the chip — never FGS
 *   notifications. EasyPark's chip works because their parking notification is
 *   posted via notify(), not startForeground().
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  - JS toggles Live Activity ON  → MihrabLiveActivityModule.display(json)
 *      → ContextCompat.startForegroundService(...) with the payload as
 *        an Intent extra. The service calls startForeground() with the
 *        FGS placeholder, then notify() with the rich chip notification,
 *        then schedules its own per-minute ticker.
 *  - Every minute the ticker re-posts the rich notification (NOTIF_ID)
 *    via notify() so the progress bar advances (progress value is
 *    recomputed each tick from prevEpochMs / nextEpochMs).
 *  - JS pushes a fresh payload (e.g. when a prayer time passes) →
 *      service updates its cached payload and re-posts immediately.
 *  - JS toggles Live Activity OFF → MihrabLiveActivityModule.cancel()
 *      → context.stopService(serviceIntent), service onDestroy() cancels
 *        the ticker and removes both notifications.
 *
 * Foreground service type: `specialUse` (Android 14+ requires a type).
 * The manifest declares the property with subtype `prayerCountdown` so
 * the platform / Play Store has a documented justification.
