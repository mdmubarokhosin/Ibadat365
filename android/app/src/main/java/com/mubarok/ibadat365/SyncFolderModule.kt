/**
 * A folder the user picked, reachable across app restarts.
 *
 * This is the Android half of the sync transport. It knows nothing about
 * envelopes, peers or merging — it lists, reads and writes text files in one
 * directory, and `folderSync.ts` does the rest.
 *
 * ── WHY THE STORAGE ACCESS FRAMEWORK, AND NOT A PATH ──────────────────
 *
 * The point of this folder is that something else already synchronises it:
 * Syncthing, Nextcloud, a Dropbox folder, a USB drive. That means it has to
 * be a directory OTHER apps can see, and since Android 10 an app cannot
 * simply write to shared storage by path. SAF is not a workaround for that;
 * it is the supported answer, and it comes with the property this feature
 * needs most — the user picks the folder, sees which one they picked, and
 * can revoke it.
 *
 * `takePersistableUriPermission` is what makes the choice survive a restart.
 * Without it the grant dies with the process and the user would be asked to
 * find their folder again every launch.
 *
 * ── DocumentsContract, NOT androidx.documentfile ──────────────────────
 *
 * `DocumentFile` would make this shorter. It is also a dependency this app
 * does not currently have, and adding one to the Android build for a class
 * that wraps a ContentResolver is a poor trade for a project that ships on
 * F-Droid. `DocumentsContract` is in the framework, present since API 21,
 * and the whole of what is needed here is four queries.
 *
 * ── ONE TAP, AND THE FOLDER MAKES ITSELF ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The picker opens already inside Downloads, and whatever the user grants,
 * this creates and then reuses a `Mihrab` directory inside it. So the whole
 * job is "tap Use this folder" — no navigating, and nothing to create by
 * hand first, which is what it cost before.
 *
 * The handle stored afterwards is the DOCUMENT uri of that subdirectory,
 * not the tree uri of the grant. Every operation below therefore asks for
 * the parent document id rather than assuming the tree root — which also
 * means a handle saved by an older build, when it was the tree itself,
 * still works.
 *
 * ── NAMES, AND WHY WRITING LOOKS FOR THE STEM ─────────────────────────
 *
 * `createDocument` is allowed to rename: a provider may add an extension,
 * or turn "x.sync.json" into "x.sync (1).json" if it thinks the name is
 * taken. If this module only ever matched the exact name it asked for, a
 * provider that renamed once would make it create a new file on every
 * single sync until the folder was full of them. So writing looks for an
 * exact match first and then for any child starting with the same stem —
 * which is this device's own id and unique to it.

   * external files directory is invisible to other apps from Android 11, so
   * a sync client could never see what we wrote there, and shared storage
   * cannot be written by path any more. `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` is the
   * supported way to get a directory two apps can both use, and it costs
